## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
- Premium state managed via `PremiumContext` with `isPremium` boolean
- Syncs with AsyncStorage and app lifecycle
- IAP handled through `react-native-iap` with Apple App Store / Google Play
- Product ID: `no_ad` (one-time purchase)

### Bookmarks Enhancement Implementation

#### New Files Created
- `components/premium-bookmarks-features.tsx` - New bottom sheet component for premium bookmark features
  - Tabbed interface: Note, Collection, Color, Manage
  - Long-press on bookmark to open features sheet
  - Only visible to premium users

#### Types Updated
- `lib/types/index.ts`: Extended `Bookmark` interface with:
  - `note?: string` - Personal note content
  - `collectionId?: string` - Reference to parent collection
  - `color?: string` - Custom color hex code
  - `isPinned?: boolean` - Whether bookmark is pinned
- Added new `BookmarkCollection` interface with:
  - `id`, `name`, `description`, `color`, `icon`
  - `bookmarkIds[]` - Array of bookmark IDs in collection
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt` timestamps

#### Storage Service Extended
- `lib/storage/storageService.ts`: Added 10 new methods to `BookmarkService`:
  - `addNoteToBookmark()` - Save personal note
  - `togglePinBookmark()` - Pin/unpin bookmarks
  - `setBookmarkColor()` - Set custom color
  - `createCollection()` - Create new collection
  - `addBookmarkToCollection()` - Add bookmark to collection
  - `removeBookmarkFromCollection()` - Remove from collection
  - `getCollections()` - Fetch all collections
  - `getCollectionBookmarks()` - Fetch bookmarks in specific collection
  - `updateCollection()` - Edit collection details
  - `deleteCollection()` - Delete collection
  - `getPinnedBookmarks()` - Get all pinned bookmarks

#### UI Updates
- `components/bookmarks-detail-sheet.tsx`:
  - Integrated `usePremium` hook to check premium status
  - Added long-press handler to open premium features sheet
  - Smart sorting: Pinned bookmarks appear first (premium only)
  - Display pin icon next to pinned bookmarks
  - Show preview of personal notes in bookmark item
  - Color-coded bookmark items based on custom color
  - Added new styles: `nameRow`, `bookmarkNote`

#### User Experience
- Premium users can long-press any bookmark to access all features
- Free users can view bookmarks normally (basic functionality unchanged)
- All premium data automatically persisted to AsyncStorage
- Changes reflected immediately in UI
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback

### For New Features
1. Most features can use simple `isPremium` boolean checks
2. For more advanced tiering (multiple SKUs), would need to extend the service
3. Data persistence features use AsyncStorage or SQLite backend
4. Sync features require backend infrastructure

### Localization Ready
- Paywall strings use the localization hook (`useLocalization`)
- Feature descriptions should be added to localization files

## Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Implement quick wins

- Quick reference cards

**Phase 2 (Next release)**: Feature expansion
- Hunt planner

- Loadout presets

**Phase 3 (Future)**: Advanced features

This approach maximizes value perception while maintaining reasonable implementation complexity.
