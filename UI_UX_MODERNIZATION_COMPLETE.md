## Progressive Disclosure Implementation

### Before (Information Dense)
- Cards showed: name + description + stats + evidence + badges
- Too much competing for attention
- Difficult to scan quickly

### After (Progressive Disclosure)
- **Cards show**: name + difficulty + key stats only
- **Tap to reveal**: full description, all evidence, complete stats
- **Scanning easier**: Focus on essential info first
- **Details on demand**: More info just a tap away

## Performance Notes
- No structural changes to data or logic
- All improvements are purely visual/styling
- Shadows are GPU-accelerated on modern devices
- Reduced visual complexity may improve perceived performance
- All functionality preserved

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile devices**: Test on iPhone 12, 13, 14+ (various sizes)
2. **Dark/Light modes**: Verify shadow/opacity works in both
3. **Accessibility**: Check font size legibility for all users
4. **Tap targets**: Verify 46-48px targets are comfortable
5. **Spacing**: Confirm breathing room feels right
6. **Performance**: Check for any lag in scrolling/transitions
