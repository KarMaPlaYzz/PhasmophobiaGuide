## 💡 Tips for Implementation

### General Best Practices
1. **Test frequently**: Run app after each component
2. **Use git branches**: One branch per feature
3. **Performance first**: Memoize heavy computations
4. **Accessibility**: Test with voice-over/TalkBack
5. **Mobile first**: Design for small screens first
6. **Dark mode**: Test all new UI in both themes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Storing large data in state (use AsyncStorage)
- ❌ Rendering full lists without virtualization
- ❌ Not handling loading states
- ❌ Forgetting error handling
- ❌ Hardcoding colors (use theme system)
- ❌ Forgetting to clean up subscriptions

### Performance Tips
- Use `React.memo()` for list items
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers
- Virtualize long lists with FlatList `maxToRenderPerBatch`
- Avoid creating objects in render methods

## 📞 Support & Questions

### For Each Feature
Refer to the specific documentation file which contains:
- Detailed implementation steps
- Code examples and snippets
- Algorithm explanations with pseudocode
- UI/UX guidelines
- Testing checklists
- Common issues and solutions

### Common Implementation Issues

**Issue**: Equipment names not matching
**Solution**: Use `Object.values(ALL_EQUIPMENT).find()` for fuzzy matching

**Issue**: History not persisting
**Solution**: Ensure AsyncStorage call completes before closing sheet

**Issue**: Colors not updating in dark mode
**Solution**: Use `useColorScheme()` hook and `Colors[colorScheme]`

**Issue**: Comparison algorithm too slow
**Solution**: Memoize results with `useMemo`, cache calculations
