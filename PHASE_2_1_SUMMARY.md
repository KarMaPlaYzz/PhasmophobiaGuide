# Phase 2.1 Implementation Summary: Balanced Ad Strategy with Frequency Capping

## ✅ Completed: Smart Frequency Capping System

### Problem Addressed
The original approach risked aggressive ad exposure leading to:
- User frustration and uninstalls
- Poor reviews ("Too many ads")
- Lower premium conversion (users leave rather than buy)
- High churn rate

### Solution: Gentle Friction Model
Implemented an intelligent frequency capping system that:
1. **Limits ad frequency** - Max 3 ads per session, minimum 2 minutes between ads
2. **Respects user status** - Premium users see zero ads
3. **Natural placement** - Ads show only at transition points
4. **Automatic tracking** - Service automatically manages counts
5. **Session awareness** - Resets when user returns to app

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Updated `lib/services/admobService.ts`

**Added frequency capping state:**
```typescript
let lastInterstitialShowTime = 0;
let interstitialShowCount = 0;
const INTERSTITIAL_MIN_INTERVAL = 2 * 60 * 1000;  // 2 minutes
const INTERSTITIAL_MAX_PER_SESSION = 3;            // 3 ads max
```

**Added helper functions:**
- `canShowInterstitialAd()` - Checks if ad meets all caps before showing
- `recordInterstitialAdShow()` - Tracks when ad was shown
- `resetSessionAdCounters()` - Resets counts when app resumes

**Updated `showInterstitialAd()` function:**
- Now respects frequency caps automatically
- Blocks ads if premium user
- Blocks ads if too soon after last ad
- Blocks ads if session limit reached
- Provides detailed logging for each decision

### 2. Refactored `hooks/use-interstitial-ads.ts`

**New hook API:**
```typescript
const { showAd, canShowAd, isReady } = useInterstitialAds();

// showAd() returns true if ad was shown, false otherwise
// canShowAd() checks all conditions before showing
// isReady() checks if ad is loaded
```

**Key improvements:**
- Simplified interface (no more configuration)
- Automatic premium user detection
- Automatic frequency cap enforcement
- Better error handling
- Premium users can't see ads (hardcoded)

## 📊 Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: User's First Ad This Session
```
T+0:00  User completes action
T+0:05  Call showAd()
        → Premium? No ✓
        → Last ad > 2 min ago? N/A (first ad) ✓
        → Session count < 3? Yes (0/3) ✓
        → Ad shown ✅
        → Log: "Interstitial ad shown (1/3 this session)"
```

### Scenario 2: Immediate Retry (Too Soon)
```
T+0:00  User tries second action
T+0:30  Call showAd()
        → Premium? No ✓
        → Last ad > 2 min ago? No (30 seconds) ✗
        → Ad blocked ❌
        → Log: "Interstitial ad blocked: too soon (1min 30sec remaining)"
```

### Scenario 3: After 2 Minute Wait (Can Show Again)
```
T+2:05  User tries action again
        Call showAd()
        → Premium? No ✓
        → Last ad > 2 min ago? Yes (125 seconds) ✓
        → Session count < 3? Yes (1/3) ✓
        → Ad shown ✅
        → Log: "Interstitial ad shown (2/3 this session)"
```

### Scenario 4: Session Limit Reached
```
T+4:15  User tries after 3rd ad
        Call showAd()
        → Premium? No ✓
        → Last ad > 2 min ago? Yes ✓
        → Session count < 3? No (3/3) ✗
        → Ad blocked ❌
        → Log: "Interstitial ad blocked: session limit reached (3/3)"
```

## 💰 User Incentive Model

The frequency caps create a gentle "friction point" that encourages premium purchase:

| Free User | Premium User |
|-----------|--------------|
| 3 ads per session | Zero ads |
| 2 minutes between ads | No wait times |
| Frustration increases over time | Seamless experience |
| Incentive to buy premium grows | Already has value |

**Expected outcome:** Users who find ads annoying have clear upgrade path, while those who tolerate ads generate revenue. Win-win.

## 🚀 Ready for Integration

Each screen can now use the hook with minimal code:

```typescript
const { showAd, canShowAd } = useInterstitialAds();

// On action completion:
if (canShowAd()) {
  await showAd();
}
```

The system automatically handles:
- Premium user detection
- Frequency capping
- Session tracking
- Logging and debugging

## 📋 Next Steps: Integration Points

Ready to add to (in order of impact):

1. **Ghost Details** (Phase 2.2) - User taps ghost to view full info
2. **Equipment Comparison** (Phase 2.3) - User opens after searching/filtering
3. **Maps Screen** (Phase 2.4) - First map view per session
4. **Sanity Calculator** (Phase 2.5) - After user calculates result

Each integration takes ~15-20 minutes following the pattern in `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## 🧪 Debugging & Monitoring

**Check logs for:**
- `[AdMob] Interstitial ad shown (X/3 this session)` - Ad was shown
- `[AdMob] Interstitial ad blocked: too soon` - Frequency cap hit
- `[AdMob] Interstitial ad blocked: session limit reached` - Daily max hit
- `[InterstitialAds] Premium user - skipping ad` - Premium user blocked

**Reset counters manually (for testing):**
```typescript
import admobService from '@/lib/services/admobService';

// Reset all session counters
admobService.resetSessionAdCounters();
```

## ✨ Why This Approach Works

1. **User-friendly** - Ads shown only at natural transition points (not mid-action)
2. **Revenue-positive** - Still shows ads regularly, but not aggressively
3. **Premium incentive** - Clear value proposition: "Buy premium for no ads"
4. **Predictable** - Users know what to expect after 2-3 ads
5. **Flexible** - Can adjust caps in production if needed
6. **Sustainable** - Low uninstall risk, high premium conversion potential

**Status:** ✅ Phase 2.1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2.2 (Ghost Details integration)
