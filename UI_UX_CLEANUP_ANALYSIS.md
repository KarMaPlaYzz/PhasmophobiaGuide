# UI/UX Cleanup Analysis & Recommendations
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Priority:** Clean, Modern, Mobile-Friendly Design Overhaul

---

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Text Density & Information Overload**
**Screens Affected:** Ghost List, Equipment List, Maps, Ghost Detail Sheet, Identifier

**Problems:**
- Ghost cards show: description + 3 stats + sanity drain + evidence badges + tap hint
- Equipment cards show: description + cost + capacity + all tags + tap hint
- Map cards show: type + stats + multiple tags + characteristics
- Too many labels and values cramped together

**Impact:** Players get overwhelmed, hard to scan quickly, especially during gameplay

---

### 2. **Spacing & Padding Issues**
**Current Standards:** `padding: 12px`, `marginBottom: 8px`, small gaps

**Problems:**
- Evidence grid cards: `marginBottom: 8px` (too tight)
- Stats groups: `gap: 8px` (cramped horizontally)
- Section titles and content: Only `marginBottom: 8px` (needs breathing room)
- Cards have minimal internal padding relative to content

**Impact:** UI feels compressed, hard to read during mobile usage

---

### 3. **Typography Issues**
**Current Font Sizes:**
- Description text: `fontSize: 12` (too small)
- Stats labels: `fontSize: 11` (tiny, hard to read)
- Evidence text: `fontSize: 10` (very small)
- Tab labels: `fontSize: 13` (too small for tap targets)

**Problems:**
- Many secondary texts are 11px or smaller
- High visual density reduces readability
- Small fonts cause eye strain during gameplay

**Impact:** Users need to squint, information not quickly scannable

---

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy Issues**
**Problems:**
- All information on cards treated equally
- No distinction between critical (essential equipment) and nice-to-have
- Evidence section competes with main content for attention
- Too many UI elements fighting for visual priority

**Impact:** Players can't quickly identify what matters

---

### 5. **Ghost Detail Sheet Overload**
**Current Structure:** Overview tab with Quick Tips + collapsible sections + identification tips

**Problems:**
- Overview tab: 50+ lines of content when expanded
- Quick tips section + full description + identification tips = 3 major text blocks
- Collapsible sections hidden but add visual clutter when open
- Evidence badges, equipment lists, tactics all dense

**Impact:** Bottom sheet feels cluttered despite tab system

---

### 6. **Card Designs (Ghost, Equipment, Map)**
**Current Pattern:** `borderWidth: 1`, `padding: 12`, `minHeight: 140px`

**Problems:**
- Cards feel boxy and utilitarian, not modern
- Heavy shadows + borders create visual noise
- Background colors too similar to surface
- Cards don't use whitespace effectively

**Impact:** Design feels dated, not premium/modern

---

### 7. **Filter & Button Styling**
**Current:** `paddingHorizontal: 12, paddingVertical: 10`

**Problems:**
- Buttons don't look clickable (no gradient, subtle styling)
- Filter buttons styled like regular buttons
- Clear distinction between active/inactive unclear
- Too many small UI elements on one screen

**Impact:** UI doesn't feel modern/interactive

---

## Recommended Changes (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Readability Fixes (ASAP)
1. **Increase minimum font size to 13px** (was 11-12px for secondary text)
2. **Improve card spacing:**
   - Evidence grid: `marginBottom: 16px` (was 8px)
   - Stats groups: `gap: 12px` (was 8px)
   - Section margins: `marginVertical: 16px` (was 8px)
3. **Reduce content density on cards:**
   - Ghost cards: Hide description text (show only on tap)
   - Equipment cards: Hide capacity and cost unless essential
   - Map cards: Remove type text, keep only name
4. **Increase section spacing:** `marginTop: 20px, marginBottom: 12px`

### Phase 2: Modern Design Update (Clean Look)
1. **Card redesign:**
   - Remove heavy borders, use subtle shadow only
   - Increase internal padding: `16px` (was 12px)
   - Use softer border radius: `16px` (was 12px)
   - Better use of whitespace
2. **Ghost card new layout:**
   ```
   [Ghost Name]          [Difficulty]
   [Speed] [Activity] [Hunt%]
   [Sanity Drain indicator]
   ```
   (Remove description, evidence, tap hint)
3. **Equipment card layout:**
   ```
   [Equipment Name]      [Category]
   [Quick stat line]
   ```
4. **Map card layout:**
   ```
   [Map Name]           [Difficulty]
   [Quick Stats: Rooms/Players]
   ```

### Phase 3: Typography Cleanup
1. **Standardize font sizes:**
   - Headings: 18px-20px (section titles)
   - Body: 14px-15px (main content)
   - Secondary: 13px (stats labels)
   - Tertiary: 12px (descriptions, if shown)
2. **Improve line heights:** `lineHeight: 1.5` for readable text
3. **Better font weights:** Clearer hierarchy with 600/700 for important items

### Phase 4: Color & Visual Cleanup
1. **Reduce colors on screen:** Limit to 3-4 accent colors max
2. **Better contrast:** Improve readability in dark mode
3. **Simplify badge styling:** Use simple colored pill buttons
4. **Consistent icon usage:** Use icons instead of text where possible
