# Phase 2.2: Premium Feature Unlock Ads - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed

### Equipment Optimizer Sheet
- **File:** `components/equipment-optimizer-sheet.tsx`
- **Change:** Added interstitial ad after rewarded ad unlock
- **How it works:**
  1. User clicks "Watch Ad to Unlock" button
  2. Rewarded ad plays â†’ User gets access to equipment optimizer
  3. After 500ms delay (respecting user experience), interstitial ad shows (if frequency caps allow)
  4. Success alert confirms feature is unlocked

### Ghost Comparison Sheet
- **File:** `components/ghost-comparison-sheet.tsx`
- **Change:** Added interstitial ad after rewarded ad unlock
- **How it works:**
  1. User clicks "Watch Ad to Unlock" button
  2. Rewarded ad plays â†’ User gets access to ghost comparison
  3. After 500ms delay, interstitial ad shows (if frequency caps allow)
  4. Success alert confirms feature is unlocked

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Approach Works

**Perfect ad timing because:**
- User has already committed to watching an ad (rewarded)
- They're already in "ad-viewing mindset"
- Frequency caps ensure max 3 total ads per session
- Only 1 interstitial per feature unlock attempt
- Premium users never see any ads

**Expected behavior:**
- First unlock attempt: Rewarded ad + Interstitial ad (if caps allow)
- Second unlock attempt (if within 2 min): Rewarded ad only (interstitial blocked)
- Third unlock attempt (after 2 min): Rewarded ad + Interstitial (if caps allow)
- Fourth unlock attempt (after 3 ads total): Both ads blocked (session limit)

## ðŸ“Š What We Got

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Premium user clicks "Watch Ad" | No ads shown (premium skip) |
| Free user clicks "Watch Ad" (1st time) | Rewarded ad + Interstitial ad |
| Free user clicks "Watch Ad" (30 sec later) | Rewarded ad only |
| Free user clicks "Watch Ad" (2+ min later) | Rewarded ad + Interstitial ad |
| Free user after 3 ads this session | Both blocked by session cap |

## ðŸš€ Non-Intrusive Benefits

âœ… **User respects this placement because:**
- They deliberately clicked "Watch Ad to Unlock"
- They're already watching a rewarded video (motivated)
- Interstitial only shows IF they've created space for it (frequency caps)
- Never disrupts natural browsing flow

âœ… **Revenue generation because:**
- 2 ad impressions per feature unlock (rewarded + interstitial)
- Multiple unlock opportunities per session
- Gentle friction encourages premium purchase

âœ… **Premium incentive because:**
- Free users see ads when unlocking premium features
- Premium users see zero ads, anywhere
- Clear value proposition for upgrade

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

Remaining placements (if desired):

### Optional: Deep Engagement Detail Views
Could add interstitials to detail sheets after 5+ seconds and every 3rd view:
- Ghost detail sheet after viewing 3rd ghost deeply
- Equipment detail sheet after viewing 3rd equipment deeply
- Map detail sheet on first map view per session

### Optional: Calculator Results
Could add interstitial after 2nd+ sanity calculator result (1-2 sec delay)

**Recommendation:** Start with current implementation (premium feature unlocks only). Monitor:
- Ad impressions per user
- Uninstall rates
- Premium conversion rate

If metrics look good, can always add more placements later.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test premium feature unlock ads:

1. **As free user:**
   - Open Equipment Optimizer â†’ Click "Watch Ad to Unlock"
   - Should see rewarded ad + interstitial ad (check logs)
   
2. **As premium user:**
   - Open Equipment Optimizer
   - Should show feature content immediately (no paywall)

3. **Check console logs:**
   ```
   [InterstitialAds] Premium user - skipping ad
   [AdMob] Interstitial ad shown (1/3 this session)
   [AdMob] Interstitial ad blocked: too soon (1min 30sec remaining)
   [AdMob] Interstitial ad blocked: session limit reached (3/3)
   ```

## âœ¨ Why This is the Right Approach

Instead of aggressive ad placement (tabs, filters, searches), we're showing ads at moments where:
1. User has explicitly requested premium access
2. User is already in "transaction mindset" (watching rewarded ad)
3. Frequency caps prevent ad fatigue
4. Experience remains smooth and non-intrusive

This maximizes revenue while minimizing uninstall riskâ€”exactly what a balanced monetization strategy should do.
