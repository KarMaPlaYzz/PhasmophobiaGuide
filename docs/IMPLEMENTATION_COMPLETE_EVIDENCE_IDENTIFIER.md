# Evidence Identifier Feature - Implementation Complete ‚úì

## Overview

Successfully implemented the **Evidence Identifier Tool** as a comprehensive ghost identification system. Players can now collect evidence during investigations and watch real-time ghost filtering with confidence scores, smart hints, and equipment recommendations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Data Layer** (`lib/data/evidence-identifier.ts`)
- 7 complete evidence types with full information:
  - EMF Level 5 (Easy, 50% of ghosts)
  - D.O.T.S. Projector (Medium, 38% of ghosts)
  - Ultraviolet (Medium, 29% of ghosts)
  - Ghost Orb (Medium, 33% of ghosts)
  - Ghost Writing (Easy, 38% of ghosts)
  - Spirit Box (Medium, 33% of ghosts)
  - Freezing Temperatures (Medium, 29% of ghosts)

- For each evidence type: collection tips, equipment needed, difficulty, rarity, ghost list, common mistakes, visual indicators

- Equipment-to-evidence mapping for quick lookups

- Contract difficulty levels with preset configurations

### 2. **Algorithm Layer** (`lib/utils/evidence-identifier.ts`)
- **Ghost Filtering**: Matches collected evidence against 24 ghost types
  - Returns categorized results: Definite (100%), Very Likely (80-99%), Possible (20-79%), Unlikely (1-19%), Impossible (0%)
  - Detects contradictory evidence (instant 0% matches)
  - Tracks matched, missing, and extra evidence for each ghost

- **Confidence Calculation**: 
  - Based on evidence match percentage and collection progress
  - All-evidence match bonus for 100% confidence
  - Considers both matched and total evidence types

- **Smart Hint Generation**:
  - Prioritizes evidence that distinguishes between remaining possibilities
  - Scores uncollected evidence by elimination power
  - Returns top 3 with priority levels (high/medium/low)

- **Equipment Requirements**: Extracts needed equipment from smart hints

- **Progress Tracking**: Shows collected vs. remaining evidence

- **Evidence Validation**: Detects contradictions and impossible combinations

- **Status Messages**: Contextual feedback based on current identification state

- **Next Step Recommendations**: Actionable guidance for players

### 3. **UI Component** (`components/evidence-identifier-sheet.tsx`)
- Bottom Sheet modal design for easy access
- 7 expandable evidence cards with:
  - Status buttons: "‚ñ° Not Found", "‚óê Investigating", "‚úì Confirmed"
  - Expandable details with collection tips (first 3)
  - Equipment requirements
  - Visual indicators per evidence type
  - Emoji icons for quick recognition

- Real-time ghost matching display:
  - Green box for definite matches (100%)
  - Blue box for very likely (80-99%)
  - Yellow warning for possible matches
  - Count of eliminated ghosts

- Progress bar showing evidence collected

- Validation error warnings for contradictory evidence

- Smart hints section showing top 3 next steps with:
  - Priority color coding
  - Elimination power scores
  - Equipment needed for each

- Equipment summary:
  - Already collected equipment highlighted
  - Recommended next equipment

- Status messages and next steps guidance

- Full dark mode support with Colors theme system

### 4. **Screen Component** (`app/(tabs)/evidence.tsx`)
- Main Evidence tab screen with:
  - Professional header "üîç Evidence Identifier"
  - Quick start guide (5-step introduction)
  - "How It Works" section (4 steps)
  - Evidence types overview with difficulty badges
  - Pro tips box with amber highlighting
  - FAB button to open Evidence Identifier sheet
  - Floating Action Button positioned at bottom-right (respects tab bar)

- Full dark mode compatibility

- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

### 5. **Integration Points**
- Already integrated into tab navigation as 5th tab
- Evidence tab uses fingerprint icon in tab bar
- FAB opens the evidence identifier sheet
- All components share the color theme system
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout

1. Opens Evidence Identifier
2. Quickly confirms 2-3 evidence types
3. Sees definite match (possibly 100% confidence)
4. Notes ghost type
5. Proceeds to hunt with correct strategy

### Workflow 3: Troubleshooting
1. Collects contradictory evidence
2. Sees validation warning
3. Re-confirms evidence
4. Reaches valid identification

### Workflow 4: Strategic Evidence Selection
1. Uses smart hints to pick high-impact evidence
2. Strategically tests distinguishing evidence
3. Efficiently narrows ghost type
4. Minimizes investigation time

## State Management

```typescript
// Evidence collection state
const [evidenceState, setEvidenceState] = useState<EvidenceState>({
  'EMF Level 5': 'not-found',
  'D.O.T.S. Projector': 'not-found',
  // ... 5 more
});

// UI state
const [expandedEvidence, setExpandedEvidence] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Computed results
const filteredResults = filterGhostsByEvidence(evidenceState);
const smartHints = generateSmartHints(evidenceState, filteredResults);
```
