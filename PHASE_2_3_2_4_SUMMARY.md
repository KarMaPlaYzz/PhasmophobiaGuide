# Phase 2.3 & 2.4: Deep Engagement & Calculator Ads - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed

### Phase 2.3: Deep Engagement Detail Ads

**Ghost Detail Sheet** (`components/ghost-detail-sheet.tsx`)
- Tracks time spent viewing ghost details (detailOpenTime)
- Only counts as "engaged" if user spends 5+ seconds
- Shows interstitial ad after every 3rd deep view
- Premium users skipped
- Logs: `[GhostDetail] Engaged view X (Ys spent)`

**Equipment Detail Sheet** (`components/equipment-detail-sheet.tsx`)
- Identical tracking to ghost detail sheet
- Counts deep views (5+ seconds)
- Shows ad every 3rd engagement
- Premium users skipped
- Logs: `[EquipmentDetail] Engaged view X (Ys spent)`

**Map Detail Sheet** (`components/map-detail-sheet.tsx`)
- Special handling: Shows ad on **first map view only per session**
- Tracks with `firstMapViewThisSession` state
- 1 second delay for map to load before showing ad
- Subsequent map views this session: no ad
- Premium users skipped
- Logs deep engagement time

### Phase 2.4: Calculator Result Ads

**Sanity Calculator** (`app/(tabs)/sanity-calculator.tsx`)
- Tracks calculation count (each time user adjusts sanity)
- Shows interstitial ad after **2nd calculation**
- Respects frequency caps (won't show if recently shown ad)
- Premium users skipped
- 500ms delay after result for smooth UX
- Increments count on:
  - Decrease 10% button
  - Increase 10% button
  - Reset to 100% button

## ðŸŽ¯ Ad Frequency Summary

| Feature | Trigger | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Ghost Details | View deep (5+ sec) | Every 3rd view |
| Equipment Details | View deep (5+ sec) | Every 3rd view |
| Map Details | First open per session | Once per session |
| Sanity Calc | User calculation | After 2nd calculation |

**Total ads expected per session:**
- Ghost details: 0-3 ads (if user browses many ghosts deeply)
- Equipment details: 0-3 ads (if user browses many equipment deeply)
- Map: 1 ad (first view only)
- Sanity calculator: 0-3 ads (if user calculates multiple times)
- **Plus:** 0-2 ads from premium feature unlocks (Phase 2.2)
- **Total maximum:** ~12 ads per very active session (respects 3-per-session cap)

**Realistic daily breakdown:**
- Light user (10 min): 0-1 ads
- Moderate user (30 min): 1-3 ads
- Power user (60+ min): 2-4 ads

All respecting the **3 ads per session max** + **2 minute minimum** between ads.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Approach Works

âœ… **Non-intrusive placement:**
- Only triggers after deep engagement (5+ seconds)
- Not on quick glances or scrolling
- Natural transition points
- Premium users exempt

âœ… **Predictable for users:**
- Users learn after 3rd ghost view or 2nd calculation
- Can "game" the system to avoid ads
- Or buy premium to skip entirely

âœ… **Revenue potential:**
- Multiple opportunities throughout session
- Balanced with frequency caps
- Still enforces purchase incentive

âœ… **User experience:**
- All delays and timing smooth
- Premium path always clear
- No disruption during active use

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

**Ghost/Equipment Details:**
- [ ] Open ghost 1 deeply (5+ sec) â†’ No ad
- [ ] Open ghost 2 deeply (5+ sec) â†’ No ad  
- [ ] Open ghost 3 deeply (5+ sec) â†’ Ad shows âœ…
- [ ] Open ghost 4 (30 sec later) â†’ Might show if 2-min passed
- [ ] As premium user â†’ Never see ads

**Map Details:**
- [ ] Open map 1st time â†’ Ad shows (after 1 sec delay)
- [ ] Open different map â†’ No ad (session limit)
- [ ] Open same map again â†’ No ad (session limit)
- [ ] Restart app â†’ Reset to first-view state

**Sanity Calculator:**
- [ ] Adjust sanity once â†’ No ad
- [ ] Adjust sanity 2nd time â†’ Ad shows âœ…
- [ ] Adjust sanity 3rd time (30 sec later) â†’ No ad (too soon)
- [ ] Adjust sanity after 2+ min â†’ Ad shows (if cap allows)

**Console Logs:**
```
[GhostDetail] Engaged view 1 (8s spent)
[GhostDetail] Engaged view 2 (12s spent)
[GhostDetail] Engaged view 3 (6s spent)
[AdMob] Interstitial ad shown (1/3 this session)
[InterstitialAds] Premium user - skipping ad
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Revenue Impact

| Component | Ads/Session | Annual Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Premium unlocks (2.2) | 1-2 | Already estimated |
| Detail views (2.3) | 1-2 | +â‚¬80-150/month |
| Map view (2.3) | 0-1 | +â‚¬20-40/month |
| Calculator (2.4) | 1-2 | +â‚¬40-80/month |
| **Total Phase 2** | 3-7 | **+â‚¬140-270/month** |

**Combined with Phase 1:** â‚¬615-865/month (target reached!)

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

### State Tracking

**Ghost/Equipment Detail Sheets:**
```typescript
const [detailOpenTime, setDetailOpenTime] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [deepViewCount, setDeepViewCount] = useState(0);

// On open: setDetailOpenTime(Date.now())
// On close: check if timeSpent > 5000ms
// If yes: increment deepViewCount, check if newCount % 3 === 0
// If yes AND canShowAd: showAd()
```

**Map Detail Sheet:**
```typescript
const [firstMapViewThisSession, setFirstMapViewThisSession] = useState(true);

// On open: if firstMapViewThisSession && canShowAd()
// showAd(), then setFirstMapViewThisSession(false)
```

**Sanity Calculator:**
```typescript
const [calculationCount, setCalculationCount] = useState(0);

// On adjustment: setCalculationCount(prev => prev + 1)
// useEffect watches calculationCount
// If calculationCount >= 2 && canShowAd(): showAd()
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Differences from Phase 2.2

| Aspect | Phase 2.2 | Phase 2.3 | Phase 2.4 |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Trigger | Feature unlock | Deep engagement | Calculation |
| Timing | Immediate | After 5+ sec | After 2nd calc |
| Frequency | Once per unlock | Every 3rd view | Every 2nd calc |
| Visibility | Always visible | Auto-trigger | Auto-trigger |

## âœ¨ Why This is Balanced

- **Not aggressive:** Only shows after user demonstrates engagement
- **Not intrusive:** Respects 5+ second threshold, never on quick browsing
- **Fair:** Same rules for all, premium users exempt
- **Predictable:** User can learn when ads will show
- **Profitable:** Still generates ~â‚¬140-270/month additional
